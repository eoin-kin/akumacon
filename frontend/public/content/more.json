      "question": "What is Akumakon?",
      "answer": "Akumakon is one of the longest running Anime and Manga conventions in Ireland. Held over a weekend, and run by students of The University of Galway, it is a non-profit convention with many events used to raise money for charity. Over two thousand people attended Akumakon 2024, making the convention one of the largest of its kind in Ireland. Ran every year (except 2021 and 2022 those don't count) since 2010, Akumakon 2025 will be our twelfth event, and we're hoping to make it bigger and better than ever."
